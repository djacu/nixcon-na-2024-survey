# NixCon NA 2024 Survey Results

Two devShells are available:

1. Modifying the Python dependencies for survey processing

    ``` shell
    nix develop .#poetry
    ```

    Use `poetry` commands to add/remove packages as needed.

2. Modifying the processing script for the survey results

    ``` shell
    nix develop .#nnasp
    ```

    All processing happens in `main.py`; modify as needed.

    You can run the script with `python main.py` and it will generate plots in the `post` directory.

There is a `discourse-post.md` file in the `post` directory.
It is a writeup and summary of the results.
