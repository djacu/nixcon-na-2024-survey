Equally, it feels like the market has only recently woken up to its value. While Nix itself has been around for a long time, the market fit is new. 

So, seeing faces from the foundation and these companies around Nix was very reassuring. It felt like intelligent people were on the job."

It's really interesting to understand the organizational and community dynamics around nix, which are just as important to making the nix project work as the underlying research and technical implementation of the tools is.","I would love to see topics that serve as an introduction of a project to potential new contributors. I'm interested in contributing. Talks that explore the internals of an ecosystem tool, but in way that js approachable and friendly to intermediate users who are unfamiliar with the given tool's codebase, would be really helpful to me personally and also, I think, to the longevity of these tools and the broader community.","5","5","5","5","The karaoke.

The center area with tables was a good space for that. I guess I can't think of something I liked least...

Honestly, although I loved colocating the event with SCaLE, the location was kind of hard to get to if you weren't in the area and didn't have a car. LA traffic sucks, and going to the airport Sunday I almost missed my flight because of bizarrely timed road work.
