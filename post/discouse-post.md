For those questions, the results were either grouped into categories and plotted or presented as responses in a table.

## Conference Attendance

## Nix Knowledge and Usage

An overwhelming majority of the survey respondents have used Nix before.
However a non-insignificant number of people have not.
Based on our reading of the raw data, some of these people may have just heard about Nix recently and some may have wondered in from SCaLE.

A comparison heatmap of how the respondent rates their skill level with Nix versus how many years they have been using Nix.
It would appear that it takes on average 2 years for users to become proficient with Nix, as indicated by the change from Beginner to Intermediate.
This tracks with some community knowledge.
Let's work together to push this entire graph to the left!

![What did you like most about the event?](./eventlikemost.png)

As it was our first conference, there were definitely some issues.
Thank you all for your candid and honest feedback about how we can improve things.

- Content
  - We definitely had a lot of beginner friendly talks.
  This was intentional as it was the first large event being held in North America and because it was co-located with SCaLE.
  However, a lot of the respondents in this category wanted more intermediate and advanced talks.
- Logistics/Communications
  - We had a schedule slip on the first day due to technical difficulties.
  It was difficult to convey that to all the attendees but we will be mindful of such an issue in the future.
  - We were not as organized as we could have been.
  Because we had to rush when organizing this conference, we did not have time to sit down and clearly establish roles for all of our volunteers.
  We felt this immediately after the conference was over.
  Shortly after the conference, we had a meeting and this came up.
  We have already begun establishing roles and responsibilities so we are more organized in the future.
- Technical
  - There were most certainly technical issues that were completely out of our control.
    - The HDMI cable connected to the projector was bad. Fortunately we were able to find a cable long enough in short time and get going.
    - GitHub began rate limiting the entire conference. This was completely out of our hands and something SCaLE had never experienced before. The SCaLE Network team is already thinking of ways to combat this in years to come.
- Schedule/Duration
  - People wanted more NixCon. Don't we all!

## Future Event Improvements

Attendees were asked what we could do to improve future events.
There is too much nuance and detail in these responses to distill it down to a chart.
Rather each answer is nominally categorized but otherwise untouched.

### Content Organization and Clarity

- Offer talks targeted at different skill levels.
- Clearly indicate the difficulty level of each talk in the program.
- Provide a separate track for beginners and advanced attendees.
- Turn introductory talks into workshops for more hands-on learning opportunities.
- Offer workshops on specific topics like packing modules and writing Nix configs.
- Implement standardized scheduling to streamline the event flow.

### Technical Infrastructure and Communication

- Coordinate with GitHub to prevent build issues due to API rate limiting.
- Establish a local binary cache from the beginning.
- Communicate schedule changes promptly.
- Provide a persistent communication platform/forum for attendees.

### Logistics and Resources

- Ensure an adequate supply of HDMI cables.
- Consider extending the event duration to allow more time for networking.
- Provide larger rooms for talks and workshops.
- Have more advertising to attract attendees.

### Community Engagement and Development

- Facilitate smaller group breakouts during workshops.
- Set up collaborative development sessions.
- Establish an information booth for newcomers to learn about community involvement.
- Structure media interactions to highlight community members and contributors.

### Entertainment and Social Interaction

- Incorporate more hype talks at the beginning of the event.
- Arrange after-hours events for closer networking opportunities.
- Encourage karaoke participation for more social interaction.

### General Positive Feedback

- Continue co-locating with SCaLE unless there are compelling reasons not to.
- Maintain the current event format as it was well-received overall.
